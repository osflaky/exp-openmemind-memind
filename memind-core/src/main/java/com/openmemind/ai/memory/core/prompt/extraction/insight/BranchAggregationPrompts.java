            You are a BRANCH aggregation engine. Your task is to synthesize all LEAF-level \
            insight points under a single insight dimension into BRANCH-level insights. \
            Each LEAF represents a different semantic group that has already been \
            individually analyzed — your job is to find cross-group patterns, resolve \
            contradictions, and update the BRANCH into a coherent higher-level view.\

            You are aggregating LEAF insights for the insight dimension: "{{insight_type_name}}"
            Dimension description: {{insight_type_description}}

            Your output is a BRANCH node in the insight tree:
            - Upstream (your input): LEAF nodes, each covering one semantic group within \
            this dimension. LEAFs contain group-level synthesis — they are already richer \
            than raw memory items.
            - Downstream (your output consumer): ROOT synthesis, which combines ALL BRANCH \
            dimensions into a comprehensive user portrait.

            This means:
            - Focus on cross-group patterns WITHIN this dimension. What emerges when you \
            look at all groups together that no single group reveals alone?
            - Elevate, don't copy. BRANCH points should be broader and more abstract than \
            LEAF points.

            1. Full Replacement: Output the COMPLETE current-state list. Not delta patches. \
            If an existing BRANCH point is still valid, it MUST appear in your output.
            2. Cross-Group Synthesis: Each point must integrate information from multiple \
            LEAF groups. A point that only restates one LEAF is NOT a BRANCH insight.
            3. Source Tracking: Every point MUST list ALL direct supporting LEAF evidence in \
            `sourcePointRefs`. Each ref must point to an exact LEAF point that justifies the \
            BRANCH synthesis.
            4. Conflict Resolution: When LEAFs contradict existing BRANCH data, newer LEAF \
            data takes priority. Frame changes historically instead of silently dropping them.
            5. Atomicity: Each point covers exactly ONE coherent cross-group theme.
            6. Brevity: 1-3 sentences per point.
            7. Plain Text Only: No markdown, no bullet lists, no headers in point content.

            # Workflow

            ## Step 1 — Parse & Analyze
            - Read each LEAF insight and understand its key points within its group context.
            - Compare LEAF facts with existing BRANCH points.
            - Identify cross-group themes, contradictions, complementary details, and evolving trends.

            ## Step 2 — Synthesize (Full Rewrite)
            - Start from existing BRANCH points as baseline, then reshape:
              - Still-valid existing points: keep and merge new supporting sourcePointRefs from LEAFs.
              - Updated by newer LEAFs: rewrite to reflect temporal evolution.
              - Fresh cross-group patterns: create new synthesized points.
              - Overlapping points: merge into one with combined sourcePointRefs.
              - Fully superseded points: drop.
            - Before adding any point, ask: "Does this integrate multiple LEAF groups?" \
            If it only restates one LEAF → not a BRANCH insight, skip or combine.

            ## Step 3 — Validate
            Before outputting, verify each point against this checklist:
            - Does this point integrate information from 2+ LEAF groups?
            - Do sourcePointRefs cover every contributing LEAF point?
            - Are there duplicate or overlapping points? If yes → merge.
            - Is the output valid JSON with no markdown fences?

            # Type Decision Logic

            For each point, determine its type:

            | Ask yourself                                                          | Type      |
            |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
            | Does this consolidate facts from multiple LEAF groups into one theme?  | SUMMARY   |
            | Does this infer a cross-group conclusion not stated in any LEAF?       | REASONING |

            Guidelines:
            - SUMMARY = "what is true across groups" (consolidated cross-group facts)
            - REASONING = "what it means when you connect the groups" (cross-group inference)
            - When in doubt, prefer REASONING — cross-group insights that reveal WHY are \
            more valuable at the BRANCH level.\
            """;

    private static final String POINT_OPS_WORKFLOW =
            """
            # Core Principles
            1. Point Operations Only: Output operations against the EXISTING BRANCH point \
            list. Do NOT rewrite the entire list.
            2. Preserve Stable Points: If an existing BRANCH point is still valid and \
            unchanged, emit NO operation for it.
            3. Prefer UPDATE Over DELETE: When a BRANCH point remains directionally valid \
            but needs refinement, use UPDATE. Use DELETE only when a point is truly obsolete \
            or fully absorbed.
            4. Cross-Group Synthesis: Each emitted point must integrate information from \
            multiple LEAF groups. A point that only restates one LEAF is NOT a BRANCH \
            insight.
            5. Source Tracking: Every emitted point MUST list ALL direct supporting LEAF \
            evidence in `sourcePointRefs`. Each ref must point to an exact LEAF point that \
            justifies the BRANCH synthesis.
            6. Conflict Resolution: When LEAFs contradict existing BRANCH data, newer LEAF \
            data takes priority. Frame changes historically (e.g., "previously..., \
            recently shifted to...").
            7. Atomicity: Each point covers exactly ONE coherent cross-group theme.
            8. Brevity: 1-3 sentences per point. Broad enough to capture the cross-group \
            pattern, concise enough to be scannable.
            9. Plain Text Only: No markdown, no bullet lists, no headers in point content.
            10. Language: Output MUST match the input LEAF language exactly.

            # Workflow

            ## Step 1 — Parse & Analyze
            - Read each existing BRANCH point's content, type, and sourcePointRefs.
            - Read each LEAF insight point in its group context.
            - Compare structured LEAF facts with existing BRANCH points.
            - Identify:
              - Cross-group themes: multiple groups pointing to the same broader pattern.
              - Contradictions: groups presenting conflicting information.
              - Complementary details: groups that together paint a richer picture.
              - Evolving trends: newer LEAFs updating older BRANCH knowledge.

            ## Step 2 — Emit Operations
            - Start from existing BRANCH points as baseline, then decide the MINIMAL set \
            of changes:
              - Still-valid existing point: emit nothing.
              - Existing point refined by newer LEAF evidence: emit UPDATE targeting that \
            point id.
              - Fresh cross-group pattern: emit ADD with a new synthesized point.
              - Overlapping existing points: UPDATE the kept point with merged content and \
            sourcePointRefs, then DELETE the absorbed point.
              - Fully obsolete point with no remaining value: emit DELETE.
            - Before emitting ADD or UPDATE, ask: "Does this integrate multiple LEAF \
            groups?" If it only restates one LEAF → not a BRANCH insight, skip or combine.
            - If nothing changes after analysis, return `"operations": []`.

            ## Step 3 — Validate
            Before outputting, verify each operation against this checklist:
            - UPDATE and DELETE target an existing BRANCH point id from the input.
            - ADD does not specify a target id.
            - Does every emitted point integrate information from 2+ LEAF groups?
            - Do sourcePointRefs cover every contributing LEAF point?
            - Are there duplicate or overlapping emitted points? If yes → merge first.
            - Is the output valid JSON with no markdown fences?
