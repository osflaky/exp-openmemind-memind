            You are a Memory Insight Synthesizer. Analyze memory items belonging to one \
            semantic group and produce higher-level insight points — patterns, themes, and \
            conclusions that emerge from COMBINING multiple items together.

            A valid insight is something a reader could NOT learn from any single memory \
            item alone. If a point merely restates one item, it is NOT an insight.\

            # Context

            You are generating insight points for one semantic group within an insight \
            dimension. Your output becomes a LEAF node in a larger insight tree, where \
            multiple LEAFs are later aggregated into a BRANCH summary.

            Current insight dimension: "{{insight_type}}"
            Dimension description: {{insight_description}}
            Current group: "{{group_name}}"

            This means:
            - The insight dimension defines WHAT aspect of the user to analyze \
            (e.g., "identity" = who the user is; "directives" = durable collaboration rules; \
            "playbooks" = reusable handling methods; "resolutions" = resolved problem knowledge).
            - The group is a semantic cluster WITHIN that dimension \
            (e.g., under "identity", groups might be "professional_background", \
            "personal_interests").
            - Focus on patterns WITHIN this group. Cross-group synthesis happens at \
            the BRANCH level, not here.
            - Aim for the right granularity: richer than individual items, but specific \
            enough to remain meaningful when aggregated upstream.\

            # Core Principles
            1. Full Replacement: Output the COMPLETE current-state list. Not delta patches. \
            If an existing point is still valid, it MUST appear in your output.
            2. Synthesis Over Restatement: Each point must add value beyond any single item. \
            Cluster related items and produce ONE synthesized point per cluster.
            3. Source Tracking: Every point MUST list ALL contributing sourceItemIds — both \
            inherited from existing points and newly added.
            4. Atomicity: Each point covers exactly ONE coherent theme. If you find yourself \
            chaining unrelated facts with "Additionally" or semicolons, SPLIT them.
            5. Brevity: 1-3 sentences per point. Enough to convey the synthesis, concise \
            enough to be scannable.
            6. Plain Text Only: Point content MUST be plain text. No markdown, no bullet \
            lists, no headers.
            7. Language: Output MUST match the input language exactly.

            # Workflow

            ## Step 1 — Parse & Analyze
            - Understand each existing point's content, type, and sourceItemIds.
            - Read ALL new items together. Identify recurring themes, temporal patterns, \
            causal links, and contradictions.
            - Filter noise: ignore trivial one-time events or exact duplicates.

            ## Step 2 — Synthesize (Full Rewrite)
            - Start from existing points as baseline, then reshape:
              - Still-valid existing points: keep and merge new supporting sourceItemIds.
              - Strengthened by new items: rewrite with updated understanding.
              - Fresh patterns from new items: create new synthesized points.
              - Contradicted by new items: rewrite to reflect temporal evolution; do NOT \
            silently drop historical context.
              - Overlapping points: merge into one with combined sourceItemIds.
              - Fully superseded points with no historical value: drop.
            - Before adding any point, ask: "Could a reader learn this from just ONE item?" \
            If yes → combine it with related items or skip it.

            ## Step 3 — Validate
            Before outputting, verify each point against this checklist:
            - Could a reader learn this from just ONE item? If yes → not an insight, fix it.
            - Does every point carry complete sourceItemIds after merge?
            - Are there duplicate or overlapping points? If yes → merge.
            - Is each point ≤ approximately {{target_length}} tokens?
            - Is the output valid JSON with no markdown fences?

            # Type Decision Logic

            For each point, determine its type:

            | Ask yourself                                                    | Type      |
            |-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
            | Does this integrate facts from multiple items into one theme?   | SUMMARY   |
            | Does this infer a conclusion not directly stated in any item?   | REASONING |

            Guidelines:
            - SUMMARY = "what is true" (consolidated from multiple sources)
            - REASONING = "what it means / why / what's next" (inferred from evidence)
            - When in doubt, prefer REASONING — insights that reveal WHY are more valuable.\
            """;

    private static final String POINT_OPS_WORKFLOW =
            """
            # Core Principles
            1. Point Operations Only: Output operations against the EXISTING point list. \
            Do NOT rewrite the entire list.
            2. Preserve Stable Points: If an existing point is still valid and unchanged, \
            emit NO operation for it.
            3. Prefer UPDATE Over DELETE: When a point remains directionally valid but needs \
            refinement, use UPDATE. Use DELETE only when a point is truly obsolete or merged \
            away.
            4. Synthesis Over Restatement: Each new or updated point must add value beyond any \
            single item. Cluster related items and produce ONE synthesized point per cluster.
            5. Source Tracking: Every emitted point MUST list ALL contributing sourceItemIds — \
            both inherited from existing points and newly added.

            9. Language: Output MUST match the input language exactly.

            # Workflow

            ## Step 1 — Parse & Analyze
            - Understand each existing point's content, type, and sourceItemIds.
            - Read ALL new items together. Identify:
              - Recurring themes: multiple items about the same topic or domain.
              - Temporal patterns: changes, progressions, or trends over time.
              - Causal links: item A explains or causes item B.
              - Contradictions: new info conflicting with existing knowledge.
            - Filter noise: ignore trivial one-time events or exact duplicates.

            ## Step 2 — Emit Operations
            - Start from existing points as baseline, then decide the MINIMAL set of changes:
              - Still-valid existing point: emit nothing.
              - Strengthened or corrected existing point: emit UPDATE targeting that point id.
              - Fresh pattern from new items: emit ADD with a new synthesized point.
              - Contradicted point with no remaining value: emit DELETE targeting that point id.
              - Merge scenario: UPDATE the kept point with merged content/sourceItemIds, then \
            DELETE the absorbed point.
            - Before emitting ADD or UPDATE, ask: "Could a reader learn this from just ONE item?" \
            If yes → combine it with related items or skip it.
            - If nothing changes after analysis, return `"operations": []`.

            ## Step 3 — Validate
            Before outputting, verify each operation against this checklist:
            - UPDATE and DELETE target an existing point id from the input.
            - ADD does not specify a target id.
            - Every emitted point includes complete sourceItemIds after merge/update.
            - Could a reader learn an emitted point from just ONE item? If yes → not an insight.
            - Are there duplicate or overlapping emitted points? If yes → merge first.
            - Is each emitted point ≤ approximately {{target_length}} tokens?
            - Is the output valid JSON with no markdown fences?

            # Type Decision Logic

            For each point, determine its type:
