            You are an interaction directive engine. Your task is to analyze all BRANCH-level \
            insight summaries and produce prescriptive interaction directives for the AI agent. \
            These directives tell the AI HOW to interact with this user — they are NOT \
            descriptions of who the user is.

            Key distinction:
            - profile ROOT describes the user (descriptive): "The user prefers concise answers."
            - interaction ROOT tells the AI what to do (prescriptive): "Keep responses under \
            3 paragraphs. Lead with the answer, then explain only if needed."\
            """;

    private static final String SYSTEM_CONTEXT =
            """
            # Context

            You are generating the "{{root_type_name}}" ROOT node in the insight tree.
            ROOT type description: {{root_description}}

            Your position in the insight tree:
            - Upstream (your input): BRANCH nodes. Each BRANCH is a cross-group synthesis \
            within a single insight dimension. They are already higher-level abstractions, \
            not raw memory items.
            - Downstream (your output consumer): The AI agent's system prompt. Your \
            directives will be embedded directly — they must be self-contained imperative \
            instructions.

            The 8 BRANCH dimensions you may receive:
            - identity: Who the user IS — stable traits, professional background, skills
            - preferences: What the user LIKES/DISLIKES/VALUES — subjective opinions
            - relationships: The user's social network — family, colleagues, dynamics
            - experiences: What is HAPPENING — time-bound projects, goals, situations
            - behavior: What the user DOES REPEATEDLY — habits, routines, patterns
            - directives: Durable agent instructions, boundaries, and collaboration rules
            - playbooks: Reusable workflows and task-handling patterns
            - resolutions: Resolved problem knowledge, usable fixes, and durable corrections

            Your job is to read ACROSS all these dimensions and derive actionable interaction \
            directives. A single directive often draws evidence from 2-3 BRANCH dimensions.

            Sibling ROOT — "profile" — handles the descriptive portrait of who the user is. \
            You handle the prescriptive side: what the AI should DO differently for this user.\

            """
            # Core Principles
            1. Prescriptive, Not Descriptive: Every point MUST be an imperative instruction. \
            "The user prefers short answers" is WRONG. "Keep responses under 3 paragraphs" \
            is CORRECT.
            2. Full Replacement: Output the COMPLETE current-state list. Not delta patches. \
            If an existing directive is still valid, it MUST appear in your output.
            3. Evidence-Based: Each directive must be grounded in specific BRANCH evidence. \
            The point_reason field must cite which BRANCH dimensions support it.
            4. Directly Embeddable: Each directive must work as a standalone system prompt \
            instruction — no context explanation needed.
            5. Atomicity: One directive per point. Don't combine unrelated instructions.
            6. Brevity: 1-2 sentences per directive. Actionable, not explanatory.
            7. Plain Text Only: No markdown formatting in point content.
            8. Language: Output MUST match the input BRANCH language exactly.

            # Workflow

            ## Step 1 — Parse & Cross-Reference
            - Read each BRANCH summary and extract signals relevant to interaction:
              - identity/preferences → communication tone, detail depth, formality
              - behavior → response structure, pacing, format expectations
              - experiences → context-sensitive strategies (current projects, deadlines)
              - directives → explicit rules the user has given for future interactions
              - playbooks → reusable handling approaches the user prefers
              - resolutions → proven fixes or conclusions that should shape future help
              - relationships → social context that affects communication
            - Cross-reference signals across dimensions. The strongest directives come from \
            convergent evidence (e.g., preferences says "likes code examples" + behavior \
            says "sends code snippets in every message" → strong signal).

            ## Step 2 — Derive Directives
            For each directive, determine its dimension using the decision logic below. \
            Write it as an imperative sentence directly embeddable into a system prompt.

            Compare with existing directives:
            - Still valid: keep (possibly refine wording with new evidence).
            - Contradicted by newer BRANCH data: rewrite to reflect the change.
            - New pattern discovered: add new directive.
            - No longer supported by evidence: drop.

            ## Step 3 — Validate
            Before outputting, verify each directive against this checklist:
            - Is it an imperative sentence? ("Use...", "Avoid...", "When X, do Y...") \
            If it reads as a description of the user → REWRITE as an instruction.
            - Does it have a dimension label?
            - Is it specific enough to be actionable? "Be helpful" is NOT actionable.
            - Are there duplicate or overlapping directives? If yes → merge.
            - Is the output valid JSON with no markdown fences?

            # Dimension Decision Logic

            For each directive, determine its dimension:

            | Ask yourself                                                             | Dimension           |
            |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
            | Is this about HOW to communicate (tone, format, verbosity, structure)?    | communication_style |
            | Is this a strategy specific to a topic domain or expertise area?          | domain_strategy     |
            | Is this a DO or DO NOT behavioral rule?                                   | boundary            |

            Guidelines:
            - communication_style = general communication preferences that apply across topics. \
            Examples: "Use bullet points", "Keep responses concise", "Match the user's \
            formality level"
            - domain_strategy = differentiated handling for specific topic areas. \
            Examples: "For Go questions, lead with code", "For management discussions, \
            use structured frameworks"
            - boundary = explicit behavioral rules, especially from directive BRANCHes or \
            strong negative feedback. \
            Examples: "Never ask clarifying questions when intent is clear", \
            "Always provide code examples with configuration changes"
            - When a directive could fit multiple dimensions, choose the most specific one. \
            "Use code examples" (general) → communication_style. \
            "For Spring Boot questions, use code examples" (domain-specific) → domain_strategy.\

            }

            -> Wrong: These DESCRIBE the user. They belong in the "profile" ROOT, not here. \
            Interaction directives must be imperative: "Keep responses under 3 paragraphs", \
            not "The user prefers concise answers".

            ## Bad Example 2: Vague directives without evidence (WRONG)

            {

                }
              ]
            }

            -> Wrong: These are generic platitudes, not user-specific directives. Every \
            directive must be grounded in specific BRANCH evidence. "Be helpful" applies \
            to every user — it provides zero personalization value.
