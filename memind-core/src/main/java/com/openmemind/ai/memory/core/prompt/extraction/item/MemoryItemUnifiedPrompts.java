            turn or immediate coordination context, such as over future days, weeks, or months.
            - Do not create a memory item just because a sentence is factual. Create a memory \
            only when it has durable retrieval value.
            - User messages mainly reveal profile, behavior, and event memories.
            - Keep assistant content ONLY when it contains durable agent instructions, \
            reusable task workflows, resolved problem knowledge, or concrete tool guidance \
            with future reuse value.
            - Do NOT extract: generic greetings, pure acknowledgements, filler and small talk, \
            process chatter, repeated facts in the same source text, temporary status updates \
            useful only inside the current session, one-off control messages, or vague \
            summaries without actionable or retrievable detail.

            coaching questions, or therapeutic phrasing unless the user explicitly adopts them \
            as a lasting routine, preference, or instruction.
            - For directive, playbook, and resolution items, normalize to reusable knowledge or \
            the durable rule itself.
            - Avoid conversational framing like "Assistant suggested:", "Assistant advised the \
            user to", or "At 2026-03-27 the assistant said...".
            - One-off control messages, transient execution commands, and session-management \
            turns are not durable agent memory.
            - A one-off command can still be extracted if it reveals a durable directive, \
            reusable playbook, project context, or resolution.

            Temporal extraction rules for time-specific memories:
            - Use `time` as the primary temporal field. Set `time` to null when no semantic \
            temporal evidence exists in the source text.
            - `time.expression`: the original temporal phrase from the source text, such as \
            "昨天", "last week", or "March 2026".
            - `time.start`: the normalized lower bound in ISO-8601 UTC.
            - `time.end`: the normalized exclusive upper bound in ISO-8601 UTC for ranges and \
            calendar buckets; use null for a single point in time.
            - `time.granularity`: one of `point`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `range`, or \
            `unknown`.
            - Time-specific memories: embed the resolved absolute date or range in the content \
            AND populate `time` only when the text itself states or clearly implies that time.
            - Profile, behavior, directive, playbook, resolution, and tool items should \
            normally set `time` to null.
            - Event items should populate `time` only when the text itself contains explicit \
            temporal evidence such as a date, relative date phrase, or clear start/end marker.
            - Do NOT use message timestamps or conversation timestamps as default temporal \
            values. They are for resolving relative expressions, not persistence defaults.
            - For `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year`, `time.start` and `time.end` must form a \
            canonical half-open bucket in the System Time Zone before converting to UTC.
            - During rollout the parser still tolerates legacy `occurredAt`, but your response \
            should use `time`.

            - "For repository comparisons, first align scope, then compare taxonomy, \

        - Use "special" only for conversational role anchors such as self, user, or assistant; do not label arbitrary nouns as special.
        - Good entities: named people, organizations, places, durable objects, and durable concepts central to the item.
        - Bad entities: pronouns, generic nouns, dates, categories, vague topics, or entities not grounded in the source.
        - Extract entities only when they help link related memories. Prefer concrete named entities and specific durable domain concepts over generic nouns.
        - Resolve role-only mentions to named entities when the source provides a name.
        - If "my roommate" and "Emily" refer to the same person, use entity name "Emily" and preserve "user's roommate" in content or alias evidence.
        - If "the PM" and "Sarah" refer to the same person, use entity name "Sarah" and preserve "PM" as role evidence.
        - Do not create separate entities for generic role mentions when a named entity is available.
        - Do not extract generic nouns such as "project", "team", "system", "issue", or "problem" unless grounded as a specific named or durable domain concept.
        - Include `"causalRelations"` only for strong explicit cause/effect links inside this response; keep at most %d per item.
        - Good causal relation: one item states a cause, trigger, enabler, or motivation for another item.
        - Bad causal relation: not for topical similarity, not for ownership or dependency, and not for simple co-occurrence.
        - `"entities"` uses objects with `"name"`, `"entityType"`, optional `"salience"`, and optional `"aliasObservations"`.
        - Each `"aliasObservations"` entry uses `"aliasSurface"`, `"aliasClass"`, optional `"evidenceSource"`, and optional `"confidence"`.
        - Allowed `"aliasClass"` values are `case_only`, `punctuation`, `spacing`, `org_suffix`, `explicit_parenthetical`, `explicit_slash_apposition`, and `user_dictionary`.
        - `"causalRelations"` uses objects with `"causeIndex"`, `"effectIndex"`, `"relationType"`, and `"strength"` in [0,1].
        - If you emit a causal relation, include an explicit strength in [0,1]; otherwise omit the relation.
        - causeIndex and effectIndex must reference different items in the same response.
